                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>A group for all those with an interest in crafts! Whether its crochet, embroidery, paper craft, or something else entirely, everyone is welcome to come to our meetings to have a chat while working on their respective projects.</p> 
                <p>We hold meetings once a week that are open to everyone. Even if you dont have a craft project, feel free to come along to have a chat. These meetings are usually held in one of the RGU buildings, but once a month we hold a vote for a local cafe and hold a meeting there</p>
